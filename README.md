Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Flutter. 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid 
with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') with the objective of getting three of 
their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Players can tap on empty cells to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') during their turn.
Winning Detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won by aligning three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
Draw Detection: If all cells are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game declares a draw.
Restart Option: Players can restart the game at any time to start a new match.

Scoreboard: Keeps track of the number of wins for each player.
